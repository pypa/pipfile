Pipfile
=======

**Warning**: this project is under active development.

A ``Pipfile`` is a new (and much better!) way to declare dependencies for your Python environment (e.g. deployment of a web application). It will be a full replacement for the well-pervasive `requirements.txt` files, currently installable with ``$ pip install -r``.

This is a concept project that will eventually be built into `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_ itself, once the API (including the form of a `Pipfile` itself) has been built out and finalized. 

Remember, the important part here is `Pipfile.lock`. It allows deterministic builds. Today's `requirements.txt` can do this, and should, but often doesn't, when version specifiers aren't provided. This efforts will provide a much more pleasant user experience. 

The Concept
-----------

A ``Pipfile`` will be superior to a ``requirements.txt`` file in a number of ways:

- Expressive Python syntax for declaring all types of Python dependencies.
- Grouping of sub-dependency groups (e.g. a ``testing`` group).
- Use of a single file only will be extremely encouraged.
- ``Pipfile.lock``


Example Pipfile
+++++++++++++++

Note—this is an evolving work in progress::

  # Note: There will be a default source, and context manager can also be used.
  source('https://pypi.org/', verify_ssl=True)

  package('requests')
  package('Django', '==1.6')
  package('pinax', git='git://github.com/pinax/pinax.git', ref='1.4', editable=True)
  dev_package('nose')

Example Pipfile.lock
++++++++++++++++++++

Note—this file is always to be generated, not modified or constructed by a user::

  {
      "_meta": {
          "Pipfile-sha256": "73d81f4fbe42d1da158c5d4435d921121a4a1013b2f0dfed95367f3c742b88c6",
          "sources": [
              {"url": "https://pypi.org/", "verify_ssl": true},
          ]
       },
      "default": [
          {"name": "requests", "version": "0.11.2", "hash": "..."},
          {"name": "Django", "version": "1.6", "hash": "..."},
          {"name": "pinax", "git": "git://...", "ref": "1.4", "editable": true},
      ],
      "development": [
          {"name": "nose", "version": "1.3.7", "hash": "..."},
      ]
  }

Example Pip Integration (Eventually)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Install packages from ``Pipfile``::
    
    $ pip install -p
    ! Warning: Pipfile.lock (48d35f) is out of date. Updating to (73d81f).
    Installing packages from Pipfile.lock...
    
    # Manually update lockfile.
    $ pip freeze -p Pipfile
    Pipfile.lock (73d81f) written to disk.
    
Notes::

    # -p accepts a path argument, which defaults to 'Pipfile'.
    # Pipfile.lock will be written automatically during `install -p` if it does not exist. 
    
Ideas::

- Resursively look for `Pipfile` in parent directories (limit 4?) when ``-p`` is bare.
