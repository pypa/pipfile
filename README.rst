Pipfile
=======

**Warning**: this project is under active development.

A ``Pipfile``, and its related ``Pipfile.lock``, are a new (and much better!)
replacement for `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_'s ``requirements.txt``
files.

Specifically, for a Python package, a ``Pipfile`` allows developers to specify
*concrete* and sets of dependencies, their locations, and their loose version
constraints. A ``Pipfile.lock`` can then be automatically generated during
package installation to fully specify an exact set of known working versions,
and future installations may refer to the ``Pipfile.lock`` to recreate the
exact contents of the environment in a *deterministic* manner. A deployed web
application, for instance, can be completely redeployed with the same exact
versions of all recursive dependencies, by referencing the ``Pipfile.lock``
file.

``pip`` will grow a new command line option, ``-p`` / ``--pipfile``  to install
the versions specified in a ``Pipfile``, similar to its existing ``-r`` /
``--requirement`` argument for installing ``requirements.txt`` files.

This repository contains the design specification of the ``Pipfile`` format, as
well as (soon) an implementation of a parser for the specification which can be
used by `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_ and any other consumer, once the
API (including the form of a ``Pipfile`` itself) has been built out and
finalized.

The Concept
-----------

A ``Pipfile`` will be superior to a ``requirements.txt`` file in a number of
ways:

* Python-like syntax for declaring all types of Python dependencies.
* One Pipfile (as opposed to multiple ``requirements.txt`` files).

  * Existing requirements files tend to proliferate into e.g.
    ``dev-requirements.txt``, ``test-requirements.txt``, etc., but a
    ``Pipfile`` will allow seamlessly specifying groups of dependencies
    in one place.
  * This will be surfaced as only two built-in groups (*default* &
    *development*).
  * Custom groups may be added in the future. Remember, it is easier
    to add features in the future than it is to remove them. The Composer
    community has been successful with only *default* and *development*
    as group options for many years — I'd like to follow this model, at
    first.

* Fully specified (and *deterministic*) environments in the form of
  ``Pipfile.lock``.


Example Pipfile
+++++++++++++++

Note—this is an evolving work in progress::

    source('https://pypi.org/', verify_ssl=True)

    requires_python('2.7')

    package('requests' extras=['socks'])
    package('Django', '>1.10')
    package('pinax', git='git://github.com/pinax/pinax.git', ref='1.4', editable=True)
    dev_package('nose')

Notes:

- There will be a default `source()`, and a context manager can also be used.
- The second parameter to `package` is used positionally, but also named `version`.
- An underlying `PEP 508 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/#environment-markers>`_
  ``requires(marker, specifier)`` will be allowed, but discouraged in favor for a small
  selection of built-ins for standard use-cases (e.g. python version, platform). This
  functionality may not be readily used, as it is only to assert (and therefore abort,
  if appropriate) installation on certian platforms (e.g. windows).

Other / lower-level functions::

    # Support for all PEP 508 markers
    requires('python_full_version', '3.6.0b1')

    #TODO: shortcut name for Darwin|Linux (e.g. `*nix`)
    requires_platform('Windows')

      ]
  }

Why not TOML & Friends?
///////////////////////

TOML is an attractive option for ``Pipfile``, especially with the recent
`PEP 518 (pyproject.tml) <PEP 518>`_ plans that are in place.

Don't worry — this and other formats are possibly being considered for
the contents ``Pipfile``.

The focus at the moment is on getting the Python representation perfect before
proceeding with true `prototypes <https://gist.github.com/kennethreitz/9319936c301be5c01f6da04e518d2cf3>`_
with existing markup languages.  However, we are optimizing for *ease of typing* for the end-user (**no
googling / boilerplate / copypasta required!**), so the Python-esque syntax
(AST-powered) will, at this time, likely exist in the final version. But,
this is being constantly re-evaluated.

It's all about making an API for Humans, first. Machines, second. Ideally,
both of these can co-exist in harmony. For example, if this Python-esque syntax
is settled on, a parser (this library, actually) will be readily available and
may have a command-line utility for converting the representation to JSON.


Example Pip Integration (eventually)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Install packages from ``Pipfile``::

    $ pip install -p
    ! Warning: Pipfile.lock (48d35f) is out of date. Updating to (73d81f).
    Installing packages from Pipfile.lock...

    # Manually update lockfile.
    $ pip freeze -p Pipfile
    Pipfile.lock (73d81f) written to disk.

Notes::

    # -p accepts a path argument, which defaults to 'Pipfile'.
    # Pipfile.lock will be written automatically during `install -p` if it does not exist.

Ideas::

- Recursively look for `Pipfile` in parent directories (limit 4?) when ``-p`` is bare.
